This ontology is developed at the Digital Humanities Lab [(DHLab)](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/) of the University of Basel and is made openly accessible for projects who wish to create knowledge graphs from travel data, historical or modern.

The ontology is developed as part of the `journeyStar` project aiming to create an RDF-star based digital edition of Reisbüchlein, the travel diary of Jacob Bernoulli (1655-1705).  The project was funded by Nachwuchsförderung Forschungfonds of University of Basel, for the duration of 7 months;
from 01.08.2023 to 31.01.2024.

The current ontology is a more generic and extended form of an ontology, developed by Nora Olivia Ammann during her master thesis project at DHLab, the codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/Nora-Olivia-Ammann/trip-ontology).
