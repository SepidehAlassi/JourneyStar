This ontology is developed at the Digital Humanities Lab [(DHLab)](https://dhlab.philhist.unibas.ch/)
of the University of Basel and is made openly accessible for projects that aim to
create knowledge graphs representing travel data.

The ontology is developed as part of the [Reisbüchlein digital edition project](https://universe.unibas.ch/projects-collaborations/10751)
that aimed at creating a region-based interactive digital edition of the travel
diary of Jacob I Bernoulli (1655-1705), Reisbüchlein. The project was funded by
Nachwuchsförderung Forschungfonds of University of Basel, for the duration of 7 months;
from 01.08.2023 to 31.01.2024. The current ontology is a more generic and extended form of an ontology,
developed by Nora Olivia Ammann during her master thesis project at DHLab.
